In this project, we are replicating two FSS file systems:
•	/u02/app/psft/ps, defined in the file fs1, that contains job logs and the report repository.
•	/u01/app/psft/pt, defined in the file fs2, that contains the PeopleSoft PeopleTools software installation.
The file system for fs1 needs to match the contents of the database as closely as possible, thus needs to have a higher frequency of replication.  In the below crontab entry, it is set to every 5 minutes (*/5) for the minutes column.
The file system for fs2 is more static and is set up to replicate once a day, at 2:00 AM (0 2).
