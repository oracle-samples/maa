# FMW Database Schemas Export and Import Scripts
These scripts are designed to export and import the FMW database metadata repository from a source database to a target database. This method can be used to migrate the database used by an FMW domain as an alternative to rman backup and restore or Data Guard approaches.

| Script name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [export_fmw.sh](./export_fmw.sh) | This script exports the tablespaces, schemas and roles of an Oracle FMW domain. It uses Oracle Data Pump Export and DDL statements to extract the information from the PDB used by the FMW system (typically a JRF or SOA domain). It creates an output tar that can be transferred to another database system to migrate the original FMW domain. |
| [import_fmw.sh](./import_fmw.sh) | This script imports the tablespaces, schemas and roles of an Oracle FMW domain. It uses Oracle Data Pump Import and DDL statements to import the output generated by the [export_fmw.sh](./export_fmw.sh) to a different PDB or to an entirely different database. |

### Features

### Considerations
- Schemas, tablespaces, and users that are not part of the FMW metadata shcemas are not included in the export and import.
