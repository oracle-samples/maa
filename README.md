# MAA samples

Oracleâ€™s Maximum Availability Architecture (Oracle MAA) is the best practices blueprint for data protection and availability of Oracle products (Database, Fusion Middleware, Applications) deployed on on-premises, private, public or hybrid clouds. Implementing Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture best practices is one of the key requirements for any Oracle deployment. Oracle Fusion Middleware and Oracle Databases include an extensive set of high availability features which can protect application deployments from unplanned downtime and minimize planned downtime. These features include: process death detection and restart, clustering, server migration, clusterware integration, GridLink datasources, load balancing, failover, backup and recovery, rolling upgrades, and rolling configuration changes.

The maa samples repository contains a set of downloadable and installable demonstrations for creating different High Availability and Disaster Protection solutions for Oracle products. Each sample can be installed independently of any of the other demonstrations and may address different tiers and components of the Oracle stack. Most examples are intended to be used in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) but may apply also to on-prem systems. Each demonstration has it's own folder within the maa repository. 

## Installation

Refer to each demonstration for the detailed steps to set up the MAA/DR topologies
