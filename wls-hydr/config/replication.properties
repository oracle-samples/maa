# Rsync delete behavior regarding files in destination that are not on origin.
# True:  rsync maintains an exact copy of the source in the destination. It deletes files from destination 
#        that are not on origin.
# False: destination and source are not an exact copy, because rsync doesn't delete files from destination, even if 
#        they do not exist on origin.

# NOTE: Syntax for excludes is the same as in rsync command.
# Do not use absolute paths. The exclude paths are relative to the source dir in each case, with this behavior:
# excludeditem    this excludes all the folders and subfolders (or files) with name "excludeditem" wherever they are. 
# excludeditem/   this excludes all the folders and subfolders "excludeditem", but not files with name "excludeditem".
# /excludeditem   this excludes only the folder or file "excludeditem" that is directly under the source dir. 
#                 It doesnâ€™t exclude other "excludeditem" subfolders or files.
# */excludeditem  exactly the contrary of the previous. It excludes all the subfolders of files "excludeditem", but copies the 
#                 "excludeditem" folder or file if it is directly under the copied folder.
# For each exclude, enter one item per line. Example:
# exclude_ohs_private_config  =  foldertoexclude1
#                                foldertoexclude2
