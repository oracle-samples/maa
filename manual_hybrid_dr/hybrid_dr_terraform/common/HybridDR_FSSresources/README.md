---------------------------------------------------------------
This terraform code is referenced in the section "Prepare the Storage on OCI" of the playbooks:  
"Configure a hybrid DR solution for Oracle SOA Suite" https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/soa-dr-on-cloud  
"Configure a hybrid DR solution for WebLogic" https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/weblogic-server-dr-on-cloud   

 
This terraform code will create: 
- 1 mount target (if only 1 AD is used) or 2 mount targets (if 2 ADs are used). 
- 4 File Systems 
	- 1 file system for the shared config
	- 1 file system for the shared runtime 
	- 1 for products1  (private file system for wls node1) 
	- 1 for products2  (private file system for wls node2). If there are 2 ADs, this will be created in the second AD. 
- 4 exports, one per each file system, in the appropriate AD. 
 
The names of the file systems and the export paths are configurable in terraform.tfvars file. 
 
Steps to use: 
- Edit terraform.tfvars file. 
- Provide the customer values. 
- Run "terraform plan" to review the resources that are going to be created. 
- Run "terraform apply" to create the resources.
